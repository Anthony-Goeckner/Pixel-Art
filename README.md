# Pixel-Art
Converts pictures into a 20 pixel x 20 pixel version of the picture by averaging the RGB values in the picture

When run, this program will ask for a path to the picture you wish to convert in the terminal, and will output the file 
in the same directory as the main program, named new.png. If the path is invalid, the program will say that it could not 
find the file, and then ask for a path again.
